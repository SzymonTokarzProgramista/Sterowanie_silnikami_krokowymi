**Project Description: Stepper Motor Control with Rotary Encoder Feedback**

This project involves controlling a stepper motor using feedback from a rotary encoder. The system continuously reads the position of the encoder and adjusts the stepper motor in real time to match its position.

As the user rotates the encoder, the motor mimics the movement by rotating to the corresponding angle or step count. This creates a smooth and responsive control system, ideal for applications such as manual CNC positioning, camera sliders, or robotics.

The main goal of the project is to implement a precise and intuitive position control mechanism using low-cost hardware and real-time processing.
